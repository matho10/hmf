# Heterogeneous Modelling Functionality (not finished)

Heterogeneous modeling functionality is a repository for python functions that enable one to model complicated dynamic programming problems for a pool of heterogeneous agents, study the their aggregate behavior, and compute the equilibrium if there exists one. These applications mostly arise in the field of macroeconomic, finance and computer science.

The core of the problem is the formalization into a state space model from an intuitive Bellman equation.
